Ideas:

2. boost Pokemon that stays for some time (loyalty buff)?

bugs to fix:
- u-turn should switch first before being hit (sometimes happen? not sure yet)
- auto battle might result in recursion error
- when fast-moving pokemon affects its battle stats, slow-moving pokemon's moves does not account for such change
- zoroark illusion type exposed due to AI calculation
- aegislash does not change name (ability still works) (fixed)
- smart AI should consider multi-strike moves (fixed)

play_test needed:
- weather_affecting moves
