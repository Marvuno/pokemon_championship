Others
1. All trainers will have their character ability
2. Some trainers will have custom pokemon, which is usually stronger and own unique ability or moves
3. The AI will know the moves of the target Pokemon, but can be deceived by its typing, and not the pokemon on the Protagonist team
4. Unless otherwise specified, original pokemon's ability can be selected via its mega form or normal form (but not limited to regional form)
5. There is a certain probability that the weather will be different (10% for different weather to occur at start)
6. There is no Draw in this game. However, if both players are out of usable Pokemon, the one with lower strength is deemed the winner.

Bug
1. If one team's pokemon got swept at the move selection process by entry hazard, the game will announce results
but still go on for one more turn for the opponent.
2. ability Illusion is partially useful to AI, due to Others#3.
